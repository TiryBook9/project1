	<h2 style="color:purple;">Junior Counselor</h2><br>
	<p>My first job was located at a daycare camp where I had my role as a counselor.

That also included being responsible for them on trips such as amusement parks, museums and other fun places that the camp chooses for them to go to.</p>

I was also providing assistance to the advisors that created programs for the kids to attend in the library.</p>
